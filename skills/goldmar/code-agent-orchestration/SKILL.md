# Code Agent Orchestration

Use `openclaw-code-agent` to run Claude Code or Codex sessions as background coding jobs from chat.

## Launch

- Do not pass `channel` manually. Routing comes from `agentChannels`, the current chat context, and `fallbackChannel`.
- Sessions are multi-turn. Continue existing work with `agent_respond` or `agent_launch(..., resume_session_id=...)`; do not start a fresh session for the same task.
- Always set a short kebab-case `name` when you care about later follow-up.
- Set `workdir` to the target repo.
- Use `permission_mode: "plan"` when the user wants a real review gate before implementation.
- Use `permission_mode: "bypassPermissions"` only for autonomous execution.
- `defaultWorktreeStrategy` now defaults to `off`. Opt into a worktree strategy explicitly when you want branch isolation.
- In `plan` mode, the plan belongs in normal session output. Do not ask the coding agent to write plan docs or transcript artifacts unless the user explicitly asked for a file.

Example:

```text
agent_launch(
  prompt: "Fix the auth middleware bug and add tests",
  name: "fix-auth",
  workdir: "/home/user/projects/my-app"
)
```

## Resume, Don't Respawn

When a session already exists for the task, keep using it.

- Waiting for plan approval: `agent_respond(session, message, approve=true)` or `agent_request_plan_approval(...)` if delegated approval must escalate to the user
- Waiting for a question answer: `agent_respond(session, message)`
- Killed/stopped by restart: `agent_respond(session, message)`
- Completed but needs follow-up: `agent_launch(resume_session_id=session_id, prompt="...")`
- Fresh `agent_launch` is only for genuinely independent work

Do not launch a new coding session from a wake event for the same task.

## State and Monitoring

Use:

```text
agent_sessions()
agent_output(session: "fix-auth", lines: 100)
agent_output(session: "fix-auth", full: true)
```

Treat these wake fields as authoritative state when present:

- `requestedPermissionMode`
- `effectivePermissionMode` / `currentPermissionMode`
- `approvalExecutionState`

Use those deterministic fields instead of inferring behavior from transcript fragments.

Approval/execution meanings:

- `approved_then_implemented`: normal approved execution
- `implemented_without_required_approval`: actual approval bypass
- `awaiting_approval`: still stopped at the approval gate
- `not_plan_gated`: no plan gate applied

Completion ownership:

- The plugin sends the canonical completion notification.
- The orchestrator should only add user-facing follow-up when there is real extra value: synthesis, risk framing, or concrete next steps.
- Do not generate your own heuristic completion summary from transcript tail lines.

## Respond Rules

Auto-respond immediately only for:

- permission requests for file reads, writes, or shell commands
- explicit continuation prompts such as "Should I continue?"

Forward everything else to the user:

- architecture or design choices
- destructive operations
- scope changes
- credentials or production questions
- ambiguous requirements

When forwarding, quote the session's exact question. Do not add commentary.

## Plan Approval

Use `permission_mode: "plan"` whenever the user wants a real planning checkpoint.

### `planApproval: "ask"`

- Approval belongs to the user.
- The plugin sends the canonical Approve / Revise / Reject prompt directly to the user.
- Wait for the user's answer, then forward it with `agent_respond(...)`.
- Do not send a duplicate approval recap or second approval prompt.

### `planApproval: "delegate"`

- Approval belongs to the orchestrator first.
- This is wake-first: the plugin wakes the orchestrator without user buttons.
- Before deciding, read the full plan with `agent_output(session, full=true)`; do not rely on the truncated preview.
- Approve directly with `agent_respond(..., approve=true)` only when the plan is clearly in-bounds and low risk.
- If escalation is needed, call `agent_request_plan_approval(session='...', summary='...')` exactly once so the plugin sends the single canonical user approval prompt.
- After that canonical prompt exists, wait for the user's decision; do not send a second plain-text approval summary.

### `planApproval: "approve"`

- Auto-approve only after verification per the session policy.

## Worktree Decisions

### `off`

- No worktree. The session runs in the main checkout.

### `ask`

- The plugin owns the user-facing completion/decision message and button UI.
- Do not call `agent_merge` or `agent_pr` unless the user explicitly asks after that.

### `delegate`

- The plugin wakes the orchestrator with diff context and no automatic user buttons.
- Read the diff context and decide whether a local merge is clearly safe.
- `agent_merge` is acceptable for low-risk, clearly scoped changes that match the task.
- Never call `agent_pr()` autonomously in delegate flows. Escalate PR decisions to the user.
- If the wake already says the plugin sent the canonical completion notification, only add user-facing follow-up when you have real extra value.

### `manual`

- Wait for an explicit user request before calling `agent_merge` or `agent_pr`.

### Never

- Never use raw `git merge` or raw PR commands in place of plugin tools.
- Never invent your own workaround for a pending worktree decision; use `agent_worktree_cleanup(session: "...", dismiss_session: true)` to dismiss permanently.
- Never merge or PR an `ask` worktree behind the user's back.

## File Artifact Policy

- Do not ask the coding agent to write planning documents, investigation notes, or analysis artifacts as files unless the user explicitly requested a file.
- Do not commit planning documents, investigation notes, or transcript-summary artifacts to the branch.
- Commit only actual code, configuration, tests, and explicitly requested documentation.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not pass `multi_turn` or `multi_turn_disabled`; all sessions are multi-turn.
- Do not pass `channel` manually unless you are debugging routing.
- Do not auto-answer design or scope questions.
- Do not infer approval/completion ownership from old transcript snippets when deterministic fields are present.
- Do not post duplicate completion or approval recaps when the plugin already sent the canonical message.
