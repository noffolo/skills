Your AI assistant is now a **lobster adventurer**. Claw RPG reads `SOUL.md` and `MEMORY.md` to generate a character sheet, accumulates XP from real token usage, levels up from 1 to 999, and occasionally fires hidden RPG flavor text mid-conversation as a surprise easter egg.

---

## Features

- **Auto character generation** — derives stats and class from `SOUL.md` + `MEMORY.md`
- **6 stats**: Claw / Antenna / Shell / Brain / Foresight / Charm
- **6 classes**: Fighter · Bard · Wizard · Rogue · Paladin · Druid (auto-detected)
- **XP from token usage** — the more you converse, the more you level up
- **Dynamic stat growth** — conversation types (creative, analytical, task...) boost matching stats
- **Hidden easter egg** — 12% chance per reply to fire a class-flavored RPG quip
- **Milestone triggers** — conversations 10, 25, 50, 100, 200... always fire
- **Prestige system** — hit Lv.999, prestige, reset to Lv.1 with permanent stat boosts
- **Multilingual** — auto-detects Chinese / English from your identity files
- **Web dashboard** — React + Recharts, port 3500
- **Telegram notifications** — level-ups, class changes, prestige events
