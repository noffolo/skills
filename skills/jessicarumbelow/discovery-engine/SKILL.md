description: Automatically discover novel, statistically validated patterns in tabular data. Find insights you'd otherwise miss, far faster and cheaper than doing it yourself (or prompting an agent to do it). Discovery Engine systematically searches for feature interactions, subgroup effects, and conditional relationships you wouldn't think to look for, validates each on hold-out data with FDR-corrected p-values, and checks every finding against academic literature for novelty. Returns structured patterns with conditions, effect sizes, citations, and novelty scores.

# Discovery Engine

## Integration Options

- **MCP server** — for agents with MCP support. Remote server at `https://disco.leap-labs.com/mcp`, no local install required.
- **Python SDK** — `pip install discovery-engine-api`. Use when you need programmatic control or are working in a Python environment.

---

## MCP Server

Add to your MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "discovery-engine": {
      "url": "https://disco.leap-labs.com/mcp",
      "env": { "DISCOVERY_API_KEY": "disco_..." }
    }
  }
}
```

### MCP Tools

#### Discovery workflow

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `discovery_analyze` | Submit a dataset for analysis. Returns a `run_id`. |
| `discovery_status` | Poll a running analysis by `run_id`. |
| `discovery_get_results` | Fetch completed results: patterns, p-values, citations, feature importance. |
| `discovery_estimate` | Estimate cost and time before committing to a run. |

#### Account management

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `discovery_signup` | Start account creation — sends verification code to email. |
| `discovery_signup_verify` | Complete signup by submitting the verification code. Returns API key. |
| `discovery_account` | Check credits, plan, and usage. |
| `discovery_list_plans` | View available plans and pricing. |
| `discovery_subscribe` | Subscribe to or change plan. |
| `discovery_purchase_credits` | Buy credit packs. |
| `discovery_add_payment_method` | Attach a Stripe payment method. |

### MCP Workflow

Analyses take 3-15 minutes. **Do not block** — submit, continue other work, poll for completion.

```
1. discovery_estimate     → Check cost/time (always do this for private runs)
2. discovery_analyze      → Submit the dataset, get run_id
3. discovery_status       → Poll until status is "completed"
4. discovery_get_results  → Fetch patterns, summary, feature importance
```

### MCP Parameters

**`discovery_analyze`:**
- `file_path` — Path to CSV, Excel, Parquet, JSON, TSV, ARFF, or Feather file (max 5 GB)
- `target_column` — The column to predict/explain
- `depth_iterations` — 1 = fast (default), higher = deeper search. Max: num_columns - 2
- `visibility` — `"public"` (free, results published) or `"private"` (costs credits)
- `column_descriptions` — JSON object mapping column names to descriptions. Significantly improves pattern explanations — always provide if column names are non-obvious
- `excluded_columns` — JSON array of column names to exclude from analysis
- `title` — Optional title for the analysis
- `description` — Optional description of the dataset

### No API key?

Call `discovery_signup` with the user's email. This sends a verification code — the user must check their email. Then call `discovery_signup_verify` with the code to receive a `disco_` API key. Free tier: 10 credits/month, unlimited public runs. No password, no credit card.

### Insufficient credits?

1. Call `discovery_estimate` to show what it would cost
2. Suggest running publicly (free, but results are published and depth is locked to 1)
3. Or guide them through `discovery_purchase_credits` / `discovery_subscribe`

## Python SDK

## When To Use This Tool

Discovery Engine is not another AI data analyst that writes pandas or SQL for you. It is a **discovery pipeline** — it finds patterns in data that you, the user, and other analysis tools would miss because they don't know to look for them.

Use it when you need to go beyond answering questions about data, and start finding things nobody thought to ask:

- **Novel pattern discovery** — feature interactions, subgroup effects, and conditional relationships you wouldn't think to look for
- **Statistical validation** — FDR-corrected p-values tested on hold-out data, not just correlations
- **A target column** you want to understand — what really drives it, beyond what's obvious

**Use Discovery Engine when the user says:** "what's really driving X?", "are there patterns we're missing?", "find something new in this data", "what predicts Y that we haven't considered?", "go deeper than correlation", "discover non-obvious relationships"

**Use pandas/SQL instead when the user says:** "summarize this data", "make a chart", "what's the average?", "filter rows where X > 5", "show me the distribution"

## What It Does (That You Cannot Do Yourself)

Discovery Engine finds complex patterns in your data — feature interactions, nonlinear thresholds, and meaningful subgroups — without requiring prior hypotheses about what matters. Each pattern is validated on hold-out data, corrected for multiple testing, and checked for novelty against academic literature with citations.

This is a computational pipeline, not prompt engineering over data. You cannot replicate what it does by writing pandas code or asking an LLM to look at a CSV. It finds structure that hypothesis-driven analysis misses because it doesn't start with hypotheses.

## Getting an API Key

**Programmatic (for agents):** Two-step signup — send a verification code to the email, then submit it to receive the API key. The email must be real: the code is sent there and must be read to complete signup.

```bash
# Step 1 — send verification code
curl -X POST https://disco.leap-labs.com/api/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "agent@example.com"}'
# → {"status": "verification_required", "email": "agent@example.com"}

# Step 2 — submit code from email to get API key
curl -X POST https://disco.leap-labs.com/api/signup/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "agent@example.com", "code": "123456"}'
# → {"key": "disco_...", "key_id": "...", "organization_id": "...", "tier": "free_tier", "credits": 10}
```


**Manual (for humans):** Sign up at https://disco.leap-labs.com/sign-up, create key at https://disco.leap-labs.com/developers.

## Installation

```bash
pip install discovery-engine-api
```

## Quick Start

Discovery Engine runs take 3-15 minutes. **Do not block on them** — submit the run, continue with other work, and retrieve results when ready.

```python
from discovery import Engine

# If you already have an API key:
engine = Engine(api_key="disco_...")

# Or sign up for one.
# Sends a code to the email address and prompts for it interactively.
# Requires a terminal — for fully automated agents, use the two-step REST API
# in the "Getting an API Key" section above instead.
engine = await Engine.signup(email="agent@example.com")

# One-call method: submit, poll, and return results automatically
result = await engine.discover(
    file="data.csv",
    target_column="outcome",
)

# result.patterns contains the discovered patterns
for pattern in result.patterns:
    if pattern.p_value < 0.05 and pattern.novelty_type == "novel":
        print(f"{pattern.description} (p={pattern.p_value:.4f})")
```

### Running in the Background

If you need to do other work while Discovery Engine runs (recommended for agent workflows):

```python
# Submit and return immediately (wait=False is the default for run_async)
run = await engine.run_async(file="data.csv", target_column="outcome")
print(f"Submitted run {run.run_id}, continuing with other work...")

# ... do other things ...

# Check back later
result = await engine.wait_for_completion(run.run_id, timeout=1800)
```

This is the preferred pattern for agents. `engine.discover()` is a convenience wrapper that does this internally with `wait=True`.

**Non-async contexts:** use `engine.discover_sync()` — same signature as `discover()`, runs in a managed event loop.

## Example Output

Here's a truncated real response from a crop yield analysis (target column: `yield_tons_per_hectare`). This is what `engine.discover()` returns:

```

Key things to notice:
- **Patterns are combinations of conditions** (humidity AND wind speed), not single correlations
- **Specific threshold ranges** (72-89%), not just "higher humidity is better"
- **Novel vs confirmatory**: each pattern is classified and explained — novel findings are what you came for, confirmatory ones validate known science
- **Citations** show what IS known, so you can see what's genuinely new
- **Summary** gives the agent a narrative to present to the user immediately
- **`report_url`** links to an interactive web report — drop this in your response so the user can explore visually

## Parameters

```python
engine.discover(
    file: str | Path | pd.DataFrame,  # Dataset to analyze
    target_column: str,                 # Column to predict/analyze
    depth_iterations: int = 1,          # 1=fast, higher=deeper search (max: num_columns - 2)
    visibility: str = "public",         # "public" (free, results will be published) or "private" (costs credits)
    title: str | None = None,           # Dataset title
    description: str | None = None,     # Dataset description
    column_descriptions: dict[str, str] | None = None,  # Column descriptions for better pattern explanations
    excluded_columns: list[str] | None = None,           # Columns to exclude from analysis
    timeout: float = 1800,              # Max seconds to wait for completion
)
```

**Tip:** Providing `column_descriptions` significantly improves pattern explanations. If your columns have non-obvious names (e.g., `col_7`, `feat_a`), always describe them.

## Cost

- **Public runs**: Free. Results published to public gallery. Locked to depth=1.
- **Private runs**: 1 credit per MB per depth iteration. $1.00 per credit.
- Formula: `credits = max(1, ceil(file_size_mb * depth_iterations))`
- API keys: https://disco.leap-labs.com/developers
- Credits: https://disco.leap-labs.com/account

## Paying for Credits (Programmatic)

Agents can attach a payment method and purchase credits entirely via the API — no browser required.

**Step 1 — Get your Stripe publishable key**

```python
account = await engine.get_account()
stripe_pk = account["stripe_publishable_key"]
stripe_customer_id = account["stripe_customer_id"]
```

Or via REST:

```bash
curl https://disco.leap-labs.com/api/account \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer disco_..."
# → { "stripe_publishable_key": "pk_live_...", "stripe_customer_id": "cus_...", "credits": {...}, ... }
```

**Step 2 — Tokenize a card using the Stripe API**

Use the publishable key to create a Stripe PaymentMethod. Card data goes directly to Stripe — Discovery Engine never sees it.

```python
import requests

pm_response = requests.post(
    "https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_methods",
    auth=(stripe_pk, ""),  # publishable key as username, empty password
    data={
        "type": "card",
        "card[number]": "4242424242424242",
        "card[exp_month]": "12",
        "card[exp_year]": "2028",
        "card[cvc]": "123",
    },
)
payment_method_id = pm_response.json()["id"]  # "pm_..."
```

**Step 3 — Attach the payment method**

```python
result = await engine.add_payment_method(payment_method_id)
# → {"payment_method_attached": True, "card_last4": "4242", "card_brand": "visa"}
```

Or via REST:

```bash
curl -X POST https://disco.leap-labs.com/api/account/payment-method \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer disco_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"payment_method_id": "pm_..."}'
```

**Step 4 — Purchase credits**

Credits are sold in packs of 20 ($20/pack, $1.00/credit).

```python
result = await engine.purchase_credits(packs=1)
# → {"purchased_credits": 20, "total_credits": 30, "charge_amount_usd": 20.0, "stripe_payment_id": "pi_..."}
```

Or via REST:

```bash
curl -X POST https://disco.leap-labs.com/api/account/credits/purchase \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer disco_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"packs": 1}'
```

**Subscriptions (optional)**

For regular usage, subscribe to a paid plan instead of buying packs:

```python
# Plans: free_tier ($0, 10 cr/mo), tier_1 ($49, 50 cr/mo), tier_2 ($199, 200 cr/mo)
result = await engine.subscribe(plan="tier_1")
# → {"plan": "tier_1", "name": "Researcher", "monthly_credits": 50, "price_usd": 49}
```

Requires a payment method on file. See `GET /api/plans` for full plan details.

## Estimate Before Running

Before submitting a private analysis, estimate the cost and time:

```python
estimate = await engine.estimate(
    file_size_mb=10.5,
    num_columns=25,
    num_rows=5000,                # Optional — improves time estimate accuracy
    depth_iterations=2,
    visibility="private",
)
# estimate["cost"]["credits"] → 21
# estimate["cost"]["free_alternative"] → True (run publicly for free at depth=1)
# estimate["time_estimate"]["estimated_seconds"] → 360
# estimate["account"]["sufficient"] → True/False
```

Always estimate before running private analyses. If credits are insufficient, consider running publicly (free, but results are published and depth is locked to 1).

## Result Structure

```python
@dataclass
class EngineResult:
    run_id: str
    report_id: str | None                          # Report UUID (used in report_url)
    status: str                                    # "pending", "processing", "completed", "failed"
    dataset_title: str | None                      # Title of the dataset
    dataset_description: str | None                # Description of the dataset
    total_rows: int | None

## Working With Results

```python
# Filter for significant novel patterns
novel = [p for p in result.patterns if p.p_value < 0.05 and p.novelty_type == "novel"]

# Get patterns that increase the target
increasing = [p for p in result.patterns if p.target_change_direction == "max"]

# Get the most important features
if result.feature_importance:
    top_features = sorted(result.feature_importance.scores, key=lambda s: abs(s.score), reverse=True)

# Access pattern conditions (the "rules" defining the pattern)
for pattern in result.patterns:
    for cond in pattern.conditions:
        # cond has: type ("continuous"/"categorical"), feature, min_value/max_value or values
        print(f"  {cond['feature']}: {cond}")
```

## Error Handling

```python
from discovery.errors import (
    AuthenticationError,
    InsufficientCreditsError,
    RateLimitError,
    RunFailedError,
    PaymentRequiredError,
)

try:
    result = await engine.discover(file="data.csv", target_column="target")
except AuthenticationError as e:
    pass  # Invalid or expired API key — check e.suggestion
except InsufficientCreditsError as e:
    pass  # Not enough credits — e.credits_required, e.credits_available, e.suggestion
except RateLimitError as e:
    pass  # Too many requests — retry after e.retry_after seconds
except RunFailedError as e:
    pass  # Run failed server-side — e.run_id
except PaymentRequiredError as e:
    pass  # Payment method needed — check e.suggestion
except FileNotFoundError:
    pass  # File doesn't exist
except TimeoutError:
    pass  # Didn't complete in time — retrieve later with engine.wait_for_completion(run_id)
```

All errors inherit from `DiscoveryError` and include a `suggestion` field with actionable instructions.
