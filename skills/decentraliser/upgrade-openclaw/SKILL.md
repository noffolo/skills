# Upgrade OpenClaw

**Stay on the edge. Update, audit, discover, propose. Latest features, always.**

## Trigger

This skill activates when the user says:
- "upgrade openclaw"
- "update openclaw"
- "check for openclaw updates"
- "what's new in openclaw"

## Settings

On first run, prompt user for preferred sub-agent model and save to `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "subagentModel": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6"
}
```

> ⚠️ **Privacy note:** If you choose an external provider (e.g. `gpt-4o`, `claude-*`), your local
> OpenClaw config and environment details will be sent to that provider during the upgrade run.
> Prefer a locally-hosted model or your primary trusted provider.

## Procedure

### 1. Check Settings

Look for `settings.json` in this skill's directory. If `subagentModel` not set, ask:

> "Which model for upgrade sub-agents? (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `deepseek-chat`). Note: external providers will receive your config data."

Save choice to `settings.json`.

### 2. Check Prerequisites

Verify required binaries are present before proceeding:

```bash
which openclaw && openclaw --version
which curl
which clawhub && clawhub -V
```

Abort and instruct the user to install missing binaries if any are not found.

### 3. Run Update

```bash
openclaw update
```

### 4. Discover What's New

```bash
openclaw --version
curl -s https://docs.openclaw.ai/llms.txt | head -100
```

Check:
- Config templates: `github.com/openclaw/openclaw/tree/main/docs/reference/templates`
- Changelog: GitHub releases

### 5. Audit Current Setup

```bash
openclaw hooks list
openclaw doctor --non-interactive
```

Look for:
- New hooks not enabled
- Doctor recommendations not applied
- Unused config options
- Relevant new ClawHub skills

**Apply these improvements?** (yes/no/select)
```

### 7. Apply with Approval

**Never apply without explicit user approval.**

Wait for the user to reply "yes", "apply", or select specific items. Do not proceed on ambiguous input.

Spawn sub-agent (using model from `settings.json`) to:
- Config changes via `gateway config.patch`
- Hook enablement via `openclaw hooks enable <hook>`
- Skill install via `clawhub install <skill>`
